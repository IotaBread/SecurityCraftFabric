## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the mod, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ByMartrixx/SecurityCraftFabric/blob/1.16.2/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Disclaimer
- This mod **was not** created by me, I am just the one who ported its code from [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net) to [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net)
- This mod is currently a work in progress. Currently, the only feature that has been fully ported is the command. Other features are still being worked on (see [commits](https://github.com/ByMartrixx/SecurityCraftFabric/commits/1.16.2) for more details of which features are being ported).
- Please, **do not** install this mod if you don't know what you are doing. Using the mod as it is right now could cause irreversible damage on your Minecraft world.
- If you have any issue with the fabric version of the mod, please open an issue describing the problem on the issue tracker **of this version of the mod**, [here](https://github.com/ByMartrixx/SecurityCraftFabric/issues).
- If you have any suggestions, please open an issue on the issue tracker for the forge version, [here](https://github.com/Geforce132/SecurityCraftFabric/issues), as I'm only porting the mod and won't add any feature that is not in the original version.
